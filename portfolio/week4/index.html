        The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup. Even though there is only one form in our example, a collection will still be returned
    </p>
    <p>
        Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then the form was submitted to the URL provided in the 'action' attribute for processing, but in this case, the URL isn't a real URL, so it doesn't go anywhere. Back-end processing isn't covered in this book, so we'll keep this as a 'dummy' URL and focus on using JavaScript to process the information instead.

        The problem with this is that the text remains in the field when the user clicks inside it, so it has to be deleted before the user can enter their own text. This is easily remedied using the focus and blur event handlers. Add the following to main.js
    </p>
    <p>
        To demonstrate all these HTML form controls, we’ll create another form that contains all these elements. Back in Chapter 5, we created a superman object that had lots of properties associated with the Man of Steel.

        Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. I’m going to use my juicer to illustrate how each of these concepts can be applied in a programming environment, since the juicer can be considered an object.

        Encapsulation, Pilymorphism, Inheritance, Classes

        The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. These are sometimes called class methods in other programming languages
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a number of ways to find the prototype of an object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every object has a hasOwnProperty() method that can be used to check if a method is its own property, or is inherited from the prototype:
    </p>
    <p>
        When an object calls a method, the JavaScript engine will check to see if the object has that method. If it doesn’t, it will check if the object’s prototype has the method. If not, it will check whether the prototype’s prototype has it.
