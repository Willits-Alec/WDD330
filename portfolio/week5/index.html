    An exception will also produce astack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single function or method call that causes an error.
</p>
<p>
    Note that not all browsers will display a warning for the code in the example above, so you might not see one if you try it out.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript is a fairly forgiving language when it comes to errors; it didn’t implement exceptions at all until ECMAScript version 3. Instead of alerting a user to an error in a program, it just failed silently in the background, and this is sometimes still the case.
</p>
<p>
    It might seem like a good idea at first, but the error might give unexpected or incorrect results that nobody spots, or lurk in the background for a long time before causing the program to crash spectacularly. Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.
</p>
<p>
    Writing code in strict mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.
</p>
<p>
    They can be very unforgiving and use some opinionated coding conventions, such as not using the ++ and -- increment operators (in the case of JS Lint). Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programmingstyle guide. This is particularly useful when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows the same conventions.
</p>
<p>
    What’s more, some browsers will support certain features and others won’t. You can’t always rely on users having the most up-to-date browser, either.
</p>
<p>
    This ensures that no error occurs if the browser doesn’t support the method, because referencing a nonexistent object such as window.virtualReality will return undefined .
</p>
<p>
    The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.
</p>
<p>
    Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to setbreakpointsin your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them.
</p>
<p>
    So far we’ve seen errors that are thrown automatically by the JavaScript engine when an error occurs. It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.
</p>
<p>
    This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. In production, however, it will appear as if the program has crashed, which does not reflect well on a ninja programmer.
</p>
<p>
    Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.
</p>
<p>
    Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass. After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work.
